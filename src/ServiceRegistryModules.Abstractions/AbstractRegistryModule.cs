// IDEA: It would be cool if I could figure out how to add the ability to inject ILogger<T> into these registries.
//       Since logging typically isn't available at the time the services are being registered,
//       I would need to create some sort of deferred logger. Perhaps it could add messages to a queue
//       then that queue could be flushed to the actual logger once it is available
